### Ideas to get started with git:

* [ ] Make a quick website: https://pages.github.com/ and host the most recent version of your resume.
* [ ] Host some code you're working on (keep your data private using .gitignore).
* [ ] Practice 'agile' work style with a piece of code using Github's built in Kanban template, pull requests, and issues.
